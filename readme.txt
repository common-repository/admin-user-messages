Admin User Messages is a simple plugin that allows communication just between Admin and single users, but not a communication between user and user.

== Description ==
With this plugin admins are able to communicate with their users. That is useful if you have a website where you don\'t want your users to talk with each other. Every term of the plugin is customizable, so you can translate it in your own language.

You will need to create some pages, to put following shortcodes in:

Inbox-Page: [admin_user_messages_inbox]

Sent-Messages-Page [admin_user_messages_sent_messages]

Write-Message-Page: [admin_user_messages_write_message]

Read-Message-Page [admin_user_read_message]

Answer-Message-Page [admin_user_answer_message]

Search-Page [admin_user_messages_search]

== Installation ==
1. Upload admin_user_messages to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
3. Create Pages, like described in Description
